# Cuda_wrapper
- remove intanciating a graph each loop and use cuGraphExecKernelNodeSetParams from cuda_driver_sys crate

# Ray marching
- Compare in gpu multiple spp (megakernel) vs one kernel launch per spp
- make a stat based adaptative sampler

# Ray tracing
- implement a first ray tracing kernel
- glTF importer

# Path tracing

# ECS
- add the camera to the ECS
- add some basic physics simulations

# main
- make the code more sustainable over time
-

# AI features
- denoiser
- neural sdf
- PINN based simulations
